2D sidescroller game // JAVA

## Introduction
This is a 2D sidescroller project, that is mainly developed as an excersice. 

## Features
The game uses my custom 2D engine and this project includes multiple new features:
* 9-slicing sprite support (chooses correct sprite by using neighbor data)
* simple gravity/physics implementation
* collision detection: similar to AABB but with points.
* jump through platforms, solid...
* camera: follow gameobject and smooth movement
